# Twitter-Robot-Detection

Politicians around the world inflates their popularity by social media metrics, to give an example
let's say we have a politician that we'll call Napoleon and other one we refer as Squealer (the names
were randomly assigned), Napoleon and Squealer both have an account on Twitter, they talk about really
important things on their tweets, but the impact they cause in the people is directly proportional to the
popularity of their tweets. What would happend if Napoleon wrote lies in his tweets? What will happend if some
untruthful tweet gain popularity in the network and many people see it, maybe the audience will believe blindly in
this information.

Napoleon and Squealer both have a way to inflate their tweets popularity, by creating fake accounts on the 
network, and making this fake accounts to retweet or like their tweets, this project is an attempt to find 
who Napoleon or Squealer have created more fake accounts.
